Exploratory Data Analysis of an e-commerce data
In this project, Imagining myself as the data analyst of this e-commerce company, I took a deep dive into the dataset, exploring its attributes and finding uncommon patterns in the data.
This data was provided by Kaggle.

Columns
* InvoiceNo: The invoice number uniquely identifies processed orders
* StockCode: Code that describes stocked goods
* Description: describes the good ordered
* Quantity: describes the quantity of the goods ordered
* InvoiceDate: date and time of which the good was ordered
* UnitPrice: The price of the goods ordered
* CustomerID: Unique Id identifying each customer
* Country: Country from which the order was made



Objectives
Using the attributes of the data, I intend to use combination of tables, charts and necessary infographics to answer questions such as What is/are the;
* Most profitable day of the week
* Month with the highest amount of orders
* Countries with the highest amount of Orders
* Total revenue or product sold by the e-commerce company
* Day with the highest amount of products ordered
* Most ordered products

Summary and Conclusion
This project demonstrates the significance and impact data has on making profitable decisions. 
A company with this data can make financial decisions based on these results such as increasing their presence in the United Kingdom and Netherlands, as a result of revenue made from the countries.Also increasing marking targets to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, to increase orders made from them. Customers with the highest amount of orders can be rewarded with coupons and gifts. These and lots more can increase revenue and reduce things such as customer churn thereby increasing profit.
